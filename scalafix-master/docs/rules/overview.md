title: All rules
---

A Scalafix rule is a small program that can analyze your source code, report
messages and sometimes automatically fix problems. The following rules come
pre-installed with Scalafix. The "Semantic" column indicates whether the rule
requires compilation with the semanticdb-scalac compiler plugin before running.
Non-semantic rules can run directly from the command line interface without
compilation.

```scala mdoc:scalafix-rules

```
